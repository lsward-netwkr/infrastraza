# infrastraza
This is the name allocated to a project where I'm attempting to learn C++ to create a lightweight device inventory, management and monitoring platform meant for Raspberry Pi SBCs, MariaDB as a database and mixing some tech for monitoring and managing I'd like to work with more - Docker and Ansible.

# Name history
Up until 2023, originally this name was planned for use for what is now [Substraza](https://github.com/lsward-netwkr/substraza), but didn't accurately describe the project so it was renamed.
